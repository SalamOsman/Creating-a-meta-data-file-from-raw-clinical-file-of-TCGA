# Summary:
The clinical information of samples in TCGA are require to process the omics data for training machine learning models, performing differential expression analysis, survival rate analysis by integrated with genomic alterations, studying biological entities in multi-dimensions (multi-layer omics studies or multi-omics), many more.
